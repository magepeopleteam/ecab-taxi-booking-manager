You can customize various aspects of the chatbot:

- **Chat Title** - Change the title shown in the chat header

- **System Prompt** - Advanced users can modify how the AI responds

## How It Works

The chatbot automatically collects information about your taxi services, including:

- Available vehicles and their details
- Pricing models and rates
- Maximum passenger capacity
- FAQs from your service listings

This allows the AI to provide accurate, contextual responses to customer inquiries about your specific services.

## Best Practices

1. **Test thoroughly** - Try various questions to ensure the AI gives accurate responses
2. **Start with default settings** - The default system prompt is optimized for most use cases
3. **Monitor usage** - AI services charge based on usage; monitor your costs
4. **Update service info** - Keep your service details and FAQs up to date for better AI responses

## Troubleshooting

### Chatbot doesn't appear
- Ensure the chatbot is enabled in settings
- Check for JavaScript errors in your browser console
- Verify that your API key is valid

### Incorrect or generic responses
- Make sure your service details are correctly entered
- Consider adding more detailed FAQs to your services
- Adjust the system prompt to be more specific

### API errors
- Verify your API key is correct and has sufficient permissions
- Check your API usage limits
- Ensure your billing information is up to date with the AI provider
